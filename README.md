# Nearest-Out
Introduction
Almost every kid, teen or even adult plays or has played some sort of video games, whether it is old or new. Most game industries make their games available to be played by everyone, despite some games being rated teen or mature. This is a smart way to increase revenue or even be the new game everyone wants to talk about or is talking about. Well, Nearest Out is just the game to grab you by the eyes and suck you in. For our game, we want you to feel like you are in the game itself. The character will be an adventurer trying to get out of the place that you are currently in. We want the player to face obstacles and enemies that will be annoying and kill or try to kill you. Our goal is to make the player not want to stop playing.


Gameplay
The player will play as an adventurer named Bjorn. You are on a mission to try to collect every coin without dying from monsters in the map. Bjorn will only be allowed to shoot his bow and arrow to kill the enemies. There are various monsters in the map that will be hindering him from collecting all the coins. It’s the user’s job to maneuver Bjorn to collect all the coins without dying. If the player dies, he will have to restart from the beginning and find all the coins again. Once the player collects all the coins, the game will end. Be careful, there will be coins all over.

Target Customers
Nearest Out will have the availability to be played by ages 7+ due to the fact in the game you are using a sword to eliminate enemies. Although they are fantasy characters that are trying to attack you in your journey, it doesn’t seem right for a child under this age (7) to be using a bow and arrow.
